                        <li>Users also made use of the "search" bar to find a specific order with a keyword

                        </li>
                        <li>Users moved their fingers up to scroll down (replication of the mental model of pushing paper for scrolling)

                            <li>Interviewed users liked to see all the customization (add-ons, ice level, sugar level, etc.) on a screen rather than trying to remember.

                            </li>
                            <li>Interviewed users felt there should have been a clearer notion to show where the card should be inserted to pay.

                    <h2 class = "subheading" style = "width: 300px;">Regular Rachel</h2>
                    <p>As a junior at Brown, Regular Rachel is often visiting Thayer Street’s TenOne for her boba boost. Typically getting three bobas a week, she follows her routine of using the ordering kiosk before heading to the seating area to wait for her name to be called.

                    <p>As a first-year at Brown, Confused Carson is excited to try boba on Thayer Street. Seeing a store he’s not familiar with, he enters, overwhelmed by the long lines and people. Feeling assured by its popularity, he takes a quick peek at the menu on the wall before it's his turn to order at the kiosk. Never using the Snackpass kiosk, he is confused and feels pressure to hurry by the line behind him.
